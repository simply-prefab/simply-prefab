    faqs: {
      1: {
        question: "What is prefab construction and how is it different from traditional construction?",
        answer: "Prefab buildings are built off-site in a controlled environment, which reduces construction time, waste, and labor costs. Traditional construction, on the other hand, involves building entirely on-site, which can be affected by weather and delays. Pre-fabricated elements are built off-site and assembled quickly on-site, ensuring rapid completion of your project."
      },
      2: {
        question: "What quality of materials does SimplePrefab use?",
        answer: "SimplePrefab uses highest quality steel of approved make in all projects. We are ISO 9001 certified and perform stringent quality checks on all materials. The grade of Primary members is 345 N/mm² and Cold Form members is also 345 N/mm². All materials meet stringent international standards."
      },
      3: {
        question: "What is the structural lifespan of a prefab building?",
        answer: "SimplePrefab buildings are designed for a structure life of 25 years. Proper maintenance as per SimplePrefab Maintenance Guidelines will ensure assured structural performance throughout the building's life. With proper care and maintenance, your prefab structure will remain durable and functional for decades."
      },
      4: {
        question: "Are prefab buildings lighter and more durable than conventional buildings?",
        answer: "Yes, SimplePrefab buildings are lighter than conventional buildings and tend to be more durable. The ability to optimize structural elements enables significant reduction of steel consumption while maintaining strength. This results in cost savings and improved performance compared to traditional construction methods."
      },
      5: {
        question: "Does SimplePrefab operate pan-India?",
        answer: "Yes, we offer Prefab construction solutions pan-India. Our team of experts can help you with your prefab construction project anywhere in the country. Get in touch with us at +91-8179 601 941 to learn more about our services in your region."
      },
      6: {
        question: "Why should I choose prefab construction?",
        answer: "Prefab construction offers multiple advantages: reduced construction time, less waste generation, lower labor costs, controlled quality due to factory environment, better weather protection, and improved accuracy. The controlled factory environment ensures consistent quality standards that are difficult to achieve in traditional on-site construction."
      },
      7: {
        question: "Are prefab buildings eco-friendly?",
        answer: "Yes, prefab buildings are eco-friendly because they generate less construction waste, use energy-efficient materials, and often have a lower carbon footprint compared to traditional construction. The factory-controlled environment also minimizes material waste and reduces environmental impact during the manufacturing and construction process."
      },
      8: {
        question: "Can prefab buildings be customized?",
        answer: "Absolutely! Prefab structures offer flexibility in design, allowing customization in layout, size, materials, and finishes to match specific requirements. Our design team works with you to create structures that meet your unique needs while maintaining the efficiency benefits of prefab construction."
      },
      9: {
        question: "Are there any design limitations with prefab construction?",
        answer: "While highly versatile, prefab buildings may have some limitations in terms of extremely complex architectural details or unique shapes that require heavy customization. However, modern prefab techniques allow for a wide range of aesthetic finishes and designs to meet most requirements."
      },
      10: {
        question: "Can prefab buildings have traditional architectural finishes?",
        answer: "Yes, modern prefab techniques allow for a wide range of aesthetic finishes, including those that mimic traditional architecture, such as brick, wood, or stone exteriors. Your prefab building can look just like a traditionally constructed building with the benefits of faster construction and superior quality control."
      },
      11: {
        question: "What is the cost per square foot for prefab construction?",
        answer: "The cost per sqft cannot be fixed as it depends on various factors including location, customization level, materials chosen, finishes, and specific client needs. We recommend our customers to take consultation from our team of experts, which will help you in decision making and provide accurate cost estimates based on your specific project."
      },
      12: {
        question: "Are consultations from SimplePrefab chargeable?",
        answer: "Yes, consultations are chargeable. However, the consultation fee will be adjusted in the project cost at the time of site handover, making it a zero-cost service for serious clients who proceed with the project."
      },
      13: {
        question: "What is the maximum height for non-load-bearing walls?",
        answer: "Our sandwich panels for walls can be constructed up to 3 m in height for non-load-bearing walls. Walls more than 3 m in height would require a suitable steel framework for structural support and stability."
      },
      14: {
        question: "How are doors and windows fixed on prefab panels?",
        answer: "You can fix doors and windows on prefab wall panels with the help of metal anchor fasteners. For steel door frames we use CSK bolts of size M (6 x 65 mm) and nuts on the panel surface. Aluminium and timber door frames are simply fixed by 2-inch wooden screws or CSK self-tapping screws."
      },
      15: {
        question: "Can prefab construction be used for different types of projects?",
        answer: "Yes, prefab panels can be used for residential and commercial, as well as industrial projects. SimplePrefab has a range of construction solutions across industries to cater to specific needs, whether for apartments, commercial offices, factories, or specialized facilities."
      },
      16: {
        question: "Can prefab panels be used for flat roof construction?",
        answer: "Yes, prefab panels can be used for flat roof construction provided with proper waterproofing and steel fabrication. Technically designed steel structure and proper waterproofing is required for using prefab panels as roof to ensure durability and weather protection."
      },
      17: {
        question: "How do prefab panel joints work and do they allow movement?",
        answer: "Prefab panel structures are joined with tongue and groove arrangements. These joints are not rigid and therefore allow lateral movements to take place. This enables the structure to withstand the movement in the earth's crust, making prefab buildings more resistant to seismic activity and ground settlement."
      },
      18: {
        question: "What panel thickness is recommended for electrical and plumbing?",
        answer: "For electrical conduiting and plumbing, we recommend 75 mm prefab panels. This thickness provides adequate space for routing electrical conduits and plumbing lines while maintaining structural integrity."
      },
      19: {
        question: "Can prefab construction be used for multi-story buildings?",
        answer: "Yes, we can construct G+1 (Ground plus 1 floor) and higher structures with prefab buildings. SimplePrefab has experience with multi-story prefab construction and can design appropriate structural systems for your requirements. Consult with our team to discuss your specific multi-story project needs."

  faq: {
    title: "Frequently Asked Questions",
    subtitle: "Get answers to common questions about SimplePrefab's eco-friendly prefab homes, construction process, materials, and services.",

    questions: {
      whatIsPrefab: {
        question: "What is prefab construction and how is it different from traditional construction?",
        answer: "Prefab (prefabricated) construction involves manufacturing building components in a controlled factory environment before transporting them to the construction site for assembly. Unlike traditional construction where everything is built on-site, prefab construction offers better quality control, reduced construction time (up to 60% faster), less waste generation, and consistent quality standards."
      },
      howMuchSave: {
        question: "How much can I save with prefab construction?",
        answer: "Prefab homes typically cost 20-30% less than traditional construction. For example, a 1000 sq ft prefab home starts from ₹15-20 lakhs, while traditional construction might cost ₹20-25 lakhs. The cost savings come from efficient manufacturing processes, reduced labor costs, shorter construction timelines, and minimal material waste."
      },
      constructionTime: {
        question: "How long does the construction process take?",
        answer: "The total timeline for a prefab home is typically 4-8 months, which includes design (2-4 weeks), manufacturing (6-10 weeks), and on-site assembly (2-3 days). This is significantly faster than traditional construction which can take 12-18 months. The exact timeline depends on the complexity of the design, size of the home, and local permit processing times."
      },
      materialQuality: {
        question: "What quality of materials does SimplePrefab use?",
        answer: "SimplePrefab uses highest quality steel of approved make in all projects. We are ISO 9001 certified and perform stringent quality checks on all materials. The grade of Primary members is 345 N/mm² and Cold Form members is also 345 N/mm². All materials meet stringent international standards and Indian building codes."
      },
      structuralLifespan: {
        question: "What is the structural lifespan of a prefab building?",
        answer: "SimplePrefab buildings are designed for a structure life of 25 years. Proper maintenance as per SimplePrefab Maintenance Guidelines will ensure assured structural performance throughout the building's life. With proper care and maintenance, your prefab structure will remain durable and functional for decades."
      },
      customization: {
        question: "Can I customize the design of my prefab home?",
        answer: "Absolutely! Prefab structures offer flexibility in design, allowing customization in layout, size, materials, and finishes to match specific requirements. Our design team works with you to create structures that meet your unique needs while maintaining the efficiency benefits of prefab construction. You can modify floor plans, choose finishes, and add special features."
      },
      buildingCodes: {
        question: "Do prefab homes meet local building codes?",
        answer: "Yes, all our homes meet or exceed local building codes and safety standards. Prefab homes require the same building permits as traditional construction. We assist with the permit application process and provide all necessary structural drawings and certifications. Our designs comply with local building codes, and we work with local authorities to ensure smooth approval."
      },
      basePrice: {
        question: "What's included in the base price?",
        answer: "Our quotes include manufacturing, delivery, and basic installation. Additional costs may include site preparation, foundation work, utilities connection, landscaping, and any premium finishes or customizations you choose. We provide detailed cost breakdowns upfront so you know exactly what to expect. There are no hidden costs with SimplePrefab."
      },
      financing: {
        question: "Do you offer financing options?",
        answer: "Yes, most banks and financial institutions provide home loans for prefab homes similar to traditional construction loans. We work with several banks that understand prefab construction and can provide construction-to-permanent financing. Some lenders offer special rates for energy-efficient homes. We can connect you with our preferred lenders and help with the loan application process."
      },
      warranty: {
        question: "What warranty comes with the home?",
        answer: "We provide a comprehensive 10-year structural warranty and 2-year warranty on systems and finishes. All materials and workmanship are covered. Most structural components come with 10-25 year warranties. This ensures your investment is protected and you have peace of mind for years to come."
      },
      ecoFriendly: {
        question: "Are prefab buildings eco-friendly?",
        answer: "Yes, prefab buildings are eco-friendly because they generate less construction waste, use energy-efficient materials, and often have a lower carbon footprint compared to traditional construction. The factory-controlled environment minimizes material waste and reduces environmental impact. We use sustainable materials and all homes can meet green building certifications like IGBC or LEED."
      },
      extremeWeather: {
        question: "Can prefab buildings withstand extreme weather conditions?",
        answer: "Yes, our prefab homes are engineered to meet local wind and seismic loads as per Indian building codes. They are designed to withstand cyclones, earthquakes, and heavy rains. The precision manufacturing and quality materials often make prefab homes more structurally sound than site-built homes. We can design homes for specific regional conditions like coastal areas or earthquake-prone zones."
      },
      panIndia: {
        question: "Does SimplePrefab operate pan-India?",
        answer: "Yes, we offer Prefab construction solutions pan-India. Our team of experts can help you with your prefab construction project anywhere in the country. Get in touch with us at +91-8179 601 941 to learn more about our services in your region."
      },
      consultationCharge: {
        question: "Are consultations from SimplePrefab chargeable?",
